        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Illiteracy is a pervasive issue, 
            hindering individuals from acquiring essential reading
            and writing skills. It perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage, 
            limiting access to education and economic opportunities. 
            Efforts to combat illiteracy include literacy programs, 
            community outreach, and policy initiatives. Addressing 
            this challenge is crucial for fostering a more inclusive 
            and knowledgeable society. By promoting literacy, we empower
            individuals to actively participate in the social, economic, 
            and cultural aspects of their communities.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Transforming education in India
            necessitates a multifaceted approach. First, a modernized national
            curriculum should be introduced, integrating practical skills and
            technology. Investing in teacher training programs focusing on
            contemporary pedagogies and continuous professional development
            is crucial. Infrastructure and technology upgrades are
            imperative, creating digitally advanced classrooms.
            Collaboration between industry and academia should be fostered
            to align education with workforce needs. Inclusivity should be 
            prioritized, addressing access disparities and promoting diversity.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A "Make in India" initiative
            for education could focus on developing and manufacturing
            innovative educational technologies and tools. This could
            include creating affordable and locally-produced educational
            hardware, software, and interactive learning materials that
            cater to the diverse needs of Indian students. Encouraging
            entrepreneurship in the education technology sector through

            indigenous ed-tech companies. </p>
